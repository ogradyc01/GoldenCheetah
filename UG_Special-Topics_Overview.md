Special Topics: Overview (Version 3.1)
***

Special topics is a collection of Wiki pages, which describe features, which do not belong to a single view in GoldenCheetah (like 'Search/Find'), or which just did not perfectly fit into one of the the other sections.

The topics are:

* [Athlete Library](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special%20Topics_Setting%20the%20athlete%20library) - the athlete library explained in detail
* [Upload/Download from/to external web-site](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Upload_Download-to_from-external-web-sites) - explains which up/download capabilities are available, how-to-configure and how-to-use them
* [Search/Filter](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_SearchFilter) - explains how to use the 'Search/Filter' field and the structure of 'Search' queries as well as 'Filter' queries
* [Activity Processing - Fix/Correct/Adjust](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Activity-Processing) - explains the available correction tools for activity data and how to use them
* [Weight settings](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Weight-settings) - explains where athlete weight data is stored and how the data is used (in case multiple weight values are available)
