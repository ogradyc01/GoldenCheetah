The tools menu contains functions which either manipulate rides or relate to additional features GoldenCheetah is providing.

* Options... - only on Linux and Windows this opens the preferences pane. Since it is an application on it's own it will remain open, even when you have closed the main window. [Preferences Details]
* CP and W' Estimator... - opens a dialog to estimate your CP and W' based on a short and long power best. If 3 minutes and 20 minutes best are used the result aligns with Monod/Scherer algorithm. Other algorithms which are also available in GoldenCheetah are not supported by the Estimator now. 
* Air Density (Rho) Estimator... opens a tool for estimation Air Density based upon temperature and air pressure. This is useful when working with Aerolab.
