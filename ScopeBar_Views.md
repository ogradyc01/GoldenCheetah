Scope Bar: Views (Version 3.1)
***

![Scope Bar] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/ScopeBar_Views.jpg)

The 'Scope Bar' provides access to the for 'Main View' variants Golden Cheetah is offering. Each view has a specific purpose and therefore specific capabilities. The general layout and UI for all views is following the same pattern. Still there are differences, which are important to understand when using GoldenCheetah:

* Trends - In 'Trends' is all around long term analysis of athlete data. Showing summaries, history data, for sure the PMC (Performance Manager Chart) and aggregated CP curves. You can either use pre-defined 'Date Ranges' for the analysis - or define your own 'Data Ranges' called 'Seasons' - to focus on certain training phases / cycles.

_Note: A very useful new feature in 3.1 in 'Trends' is the ability to 'Compare' the athlete data of different 'Date Ranges' with each other. And here not only data of a single athlete, but also cross-athlete.

2. [Chart Types for Trends]
3. [Compare Pane in Trends]

* Diary - The'Diary' view is a kind of bridge betweent 'Trends' - where you analyse mid- and long-term aspects of your training, and the analysis of a single ride in 'Rides'. In 'Diary' you find different types of summaries, an configurable Ride/Activity Log and a 'big' calendar. You can also add some chart types which are also available on 'Trends' view.

_Note: Diary does not provide a 'Compare Pane', so the respective menu function and tool bar button has no effect.'
