Compare Pane: General (Version 3.1)
***

The compare pane is a very powerful new feature of GoldenCheetah 3.1 - depending on the view you are on (Trends or Rides) it allows the comparison of Date Ranges (Trends) or Rides/Intervals (Rides).

The handling of the compare pane is the same for both views:

## Selection of data for comparison



## Compare on/off and clearing of view



## Specifics for the views


* [Compare Pane: Trends view]
* [Compare Pane: Rides view]
