Compare Pane: General (Version 3.1)
***

The compare pane is a very powerful new feature of GoldenCheetah 3.1 - depending on the view you are on (Trends or Rides) it allows the comparison of Date Ranges (Trends) or Rides/Intervals (Rides).

The handling of the compare pane is the same for both views, here the common concepts - based on a 'Rides' view example:

## Selection of data for comparison

The selection of data for to be compared works in same way for 'Rides', 'Intervals' and 'Date Ranges'. It's a "Drag&Drop" concept - as shown below. You do not even need to open the 'Compare Pane', but just "Drag&Drop" the first item to compare to the bottom of the 'Main View':
