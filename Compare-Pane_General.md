Compare Pane: General (Version 3.1)
***

The compare pane is a very powerful new feature of GoldenCheetah 3.1 - depending on the view you are on (Trends or Rides) it allows the comparison of Date Ranges (Trends) or Rides/Intervals (Rides).

The handling of the compare pane is the same for both views, here the common concepts - based on a 'Rides' view example:

## Selection of data for comparison

The selection of data for to be compared works in same way for 'Rides', 'Intervals' and 'Date Ranges'. It's a "Drag&Drop" concept - as shown below. You do not even need to open the 'Compare Pane', but just "Drag&Drop" the first item to compare to the bottom of the 'Main View':

_Note: You can select items ('Rides', 'Intervals' and 'Date Ranges') not only from the athlete you are currently working with, but also from other athletes - for this you need to open the other athlete in a separate window to be able to "drag&drop" items._

## Compare on/off, sorting of items and clearing 

* To activate the comparison the selected items ('Rides', 'Interval' or 'Date Ranges'), you need to push the `OFF` button in the 'Compare Pane'. With this the charts in the main view change into a comparison view and the button changes to `ON`. Pressing again ends the compare mode.

* Using the 'Check boxes' on the left border of the 'Compare Pane' allow to include/exclude single items from the comparison. The first item is always checked as the comparison reference.

* You can also sort the items by 'mouse-click' on the respective column header. Whith the sort, also the reference items changes (but is always the first item in the list).

_Note: Comparison views have been implemented for most of the charts - but only for those, where a comparison makes sense. E.g. there is no comparison for the Google/Bing map chart._
