# ![Logo] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/GC_logo_small.png) Golden Cheetah: User's Guide 


The main focus of this new GoldenCheetah User's Guide is to describe the features and functions provided by Golden Cheetah by 
* [going through all the steps a new user has to do when starting](http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/First Steps_What you need to do)
* [explaining the general UI structure and concepts]
(http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/General_UI Layout and terminology)
* [explaining the different views]
(http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/ScopeBar_Views)
* [explaining the chart type(s) which are available per view]
(http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/General_ChartTypes)
* [explaining the preferences you can configure]
* providing general tipps and tricks on GoldenCheetah UI and more
* explaining general features which are used in multiple functions (e.g Search/Filter)
* adding some country specific information (e.g. related to who things are translated)
* [other knowledge sources](http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics_Other information)

And here a link the 'Table of Contents' of this user guide:

* [Table of Contents] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Main-Page_Table-of-contents)

There are some assumptions taken regarding what this guides is NOT. It's
* not a developer's or build guide for GC / it assumes you are using a stable version of the software with minimum release level 3.1
* not an introduction into power based training / it assumes that you have a basic understanding on power based training together with knowledge on the common terminology
* not an full introduction into all GoldenCheetah metrics / it will deliver information on the metrics which are important to understand the software, but not provide detailed background on the metrics provided

Since new versions of Golden Cheetah coming out frequently this WiKi is planned to be updated as soon as new functionality is available. To track the the releases, each WiKi page has a common header, outlining from which release onwards a feature is available / or if a feature is deprecated in a certain release.

For first time users of GoldenCheetah we recommended to at least 'flip-through' the whole Wiki - ideally with GoldenCheetah running in a second window and make yourself familiar with the concepts and features. Once you have done this, use the WiKi to re-visit specific details and concepts which you are using in GoldenCheetah. Most of the GoldenCheetah functionality is very straight forward and self-explanatory. This Wiki will not elaborate on these functions in broad details (everyone of you knows how to select of file for upload, so no need to explain this here) - but the Wiki aims to cover special features related to such features - such as (where to I have context menus on (right) mouse-click, where to I have mouse-over features, what is the impact of moving my athlet directory,...) - so all the things you might face when you use GoldenCheetah.

_Note: All screenhots are taken on a Windows 7 installation of GoldenCheetah. Installations on other operating systems supported by GoldenCheetah will have a slightly different look&feel._

_Disclaimer: The Wiki is written to help users to explore the capabilities of GoldenCheetah and to learn all of it's functionality. As any documentation, it will have errors and is always incomplete. Also there will be typos and you will easily notice that this new User's guide is not written by an english native speaker. As the Wiki is open to any GitHub user - improvements and enhancements are welcome. Please try to follow the structure provided initially (best seen in the Table of Contents). In case you do not want to edit, but like to provide direct feedback, ideas for improvement,.. please send a mail to "joern.rm at gmail.com". - Thanks_
