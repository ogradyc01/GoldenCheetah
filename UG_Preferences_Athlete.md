Preferences: Athlete (Version 3.2)
***

_Select:_ `Menu Bar -> Tools -> Options...` to get to the 'Options' Popup.

The athlete specific data allows to change the settings you have done when creating a new athlete and also completes them by setting up the 'Power' and 'Heartrate' zones for the athlete.

_Note: All on this view is stored for the current athlete._

In the `About` tab you can change some basic settings, and add a picture for the athlete (if you want to). To add a picture, just click on the 'picture' area to open a 'File Selector' dialog box. You can select image files of types (.png, .bmp, .jpg). If your file selector does not show any files, use the operating system dependent search syntax in the 'File Name' field. (e.g. in Windows its "*.*). When selecting a picture it's automatically loaded and copied to your athlete specific data in the 'Athlete Library'.

Fields which you have to maintain on this view are:

* `Unit` - set the correct Unit of Measurement, which is used in metrics calculation and display
* `Weight` - set the default weight, which is used in metrics calculation and display

For 'Weight' please also check: [Special Topics: Weight settings](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Weight-settings) 

The next three tabs `Power Zones`, `Heartrate Zones`, and `Pace Zones` allow you to setup the training zones for the athlete. GoldenCheetah allows a time dependent and very flexible definition of zones for 'Power' and 'Heartrate' as well as the definition of 'Pace Zones' separate for 'Run' and 'Swim' activities. In this documentation we assume that you are familiar with the concepts behind training zones and will just explain how zones are configured.

The last tab `Auto Import` allows the configuration of a number of directory which are scan for activity/ride files when Golden Cheetah is started. When found, showing the list and automatically importing new activities to GoldenCheetah.
