`CP`: Critical Power. A power that theoretically can be maintained for a indefinitely long time without fatigue.

`FTP` : Functional Threshold Power. The highest power that a rider can maintain in a quasi-steady state without fatiguing for approximately one hour.

`W'` : Formerly known as Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC)

`ATL` : Acute Training Load.

`CTL` : Chronic Training Load. A rolling daily average of how much training load, measured by each workouts Training Stress Score (TSS), an athlete is managing. 

`TSB®` : Training Stress Balance.

`TSS®` : Training Stress Score. A quantification of the training session that takes into account the duration and intensity of the training.

`P-max` : maximal power over one full rotation of the cranks.

`RR` : Ramp Rate. The ramp rate of your Chronic Training Load (CTL). It's expressed in TSS/day

`Endurance index` : CP/W'

`QA` : Quadrant Analysis. It's a way to measure the neuromuscular power demands of cycling. Quadrant 1 (upper right: high force and high cadence. Quadrant 2 (upper left): high force and low cadence. Quadrant 3 (lower left): low force and low cadence. Quadrant 4 (lower right): low force and high cadence
