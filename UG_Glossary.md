`CP`: Critical Power. A power that theoretically can be maintained for a indefinitely long time without fatigue.

`FTP` : Functional Threshold Power. The highest power that a rider can maintain in a quasi-steady state without fatiguing for approximately one hour.

`W'` or `W'bal` : Formerly known as Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC). A fixed amount of work, expressed in kJ, that you can do above Critical Power.

`Tau` : your rate of replenishing your W' stores.

`TSS` : Training Stress Score®. A quantification of the training session that takes into account the duration and intensity of the training based on the power data. It's intended to estimate the training load and physiological stress created by that session (it's conceptually modeled after the heart rate-based training load, TRIMP).

`ATL` : Acute Training Load®. The dose of training that you accumulated over a short period of time, from 3 to 10 days in general. It relates to your fatigue.

`CTL` : Chronic Training Load®. The the dose of training you accumulated over a longer period of time, from a couple of months to years. It relates to your fitness.

`RR` : Ramp Rate. The ramp rate of your Chronic Training Load (CTL). Joel Friel considers that a CTL ramp rate of 5 to 8 points per week is about right for most.

`TSB` : Training Stress Balance®. It’s the result of subtracting today’s Acute Training Load (“fatigue”) from today’s Chronic Training Load (“fitness”). In general terms, if it's negative,  you're fatigued, and if it's positive you're fresh. It relates to your form or freshness.

`TRIMP`: Training Impulse. A method to quantify training load. It takes into consideration the intensity of exercise as calculated by the heart rate (HR) and the duration of exercise. 

`P-max` : maximal power over one full rotation of the cranks.

`Endurance index` : the ratio of W' to CP.

`QA` : Quadrant Analysis. It's a way to measure the neuromuscular power demands of cycling. Quadrant 1 (upper right: high force and high cadence. Quadrant 2 (upper left): high force and low cadence. Quadrant 3 (lower left): low force and low cadence. Quadrant 4 (lower right): low force and high cadence

`xPower` : 

`TISS` : it's a metric to quantify the training strain, as opposed to the training load/stress (like TSS and TRIMP).

`Relative intensity` : This is how your xPower relates to your FTP. When xPower = FTP, the intensity is 1.

`BikeScore` :  A quantification of the training session that takes into account the duration and intensity of the training (it's based on the power data). It's intended to estimate the training load and physiological stress created by that session. See TSS, Trimp.

`TriScore` : a combined stress score computed according to sport: BikeScore for cycling, GOVSS for running and SwimScore for swimming.
