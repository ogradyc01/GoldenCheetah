`CP`: Critical Power. A power that theoretically can be maintained for a indefinitely long time without fatigue.

`FTP` : Functional Threshold Power. The highest power that a rider can maintain in a quasi-steady state without fatiguing for approximately one hour.

`W'` or `W'bal` : Formerly known as Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC). A fixed amount of work, expressed in kJ, that you can do above Critical Power.

`Tau` : your rate of replenishing your W' stores.

`TSS®` : Training Stress Score. A quantification of the training session that takes into account the duration and intensity of the training based on the power data. It's intended to estimate the training load and physiological stress created by that session (it's conceptually modeled after the heart rate-based training load, TRIMP).

`ATL` : Acute Training Load®. The dose of training that you accumulated over a short period of time. From 3 to 10 days in general. It relates to your fatigue.

`CTL` : Chronic Training Load®. The cumulative training dose that builds up over a longer period of time, from a couple of months to years. It relates to your fitness.

`RR` : Ramp Rate. The ramp rate of your Chronic Training Load (CTL). It's expressed in TSS/day.

`TSB®` : Training Stress Balance. It’s the result of subtracting today’s Acute Training Load (“fatigue”) from today’s Chronic Training Load (“fitness”). It relates to your form or freshness.

`TRIMP`: a method to quantify training load. It takes into consideration the intensity of exercise as calculated by the heart rate (HR) and the duration of exercise. 

`P-max` : maximal power over one full rotation of the cranks.

`Endurance index` : the ratio of W' to CP.

`QA` : Quadrant Analysis. It's a way to measure the neuromuscular power demands of cycling. Quadrant 1 (upper right: high force and high cadence. Quadrant 2 (upper left): high force and low cadence. Quadrant 3 (lower left): low force and low cadence. Quadrant 4 (lower right): low force and high cadence
