The main focus of this new Golden Cheetah User's Guide is to describe the features and functions provided by Golden Cheetah by 
* [going through all the steps a new user has to do when starting] [First Steps](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/First Steps: Prerequisites )
* explaining the different views and charts provided
* providing general tipps and tricks on Golden Cheetah UI and more
* explaining general features which are used in multiple functions (e.g Search/Filter)
* adding some country specific information (e.g. related to who things are translated)

There are some assumptions taken regarding what this guides is NOT. It's
* not a developer's or build guide for GC / it assumes you are using a stable version of the software with minimum release level 3.1
* not an introduction into power based training / it assumes that you have a basic understaning on power based training together with knowledge on the common termiology

Since new versions of Golden Cheetah coming out frequently this WiKi is planned to be updated as soon as new functionality is available. To track the the releases, each WiKi page will have a common header, outlining from which release onwards a feature is available / or if a feature is deprecated in a certain release.
