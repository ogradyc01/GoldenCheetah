General: UI Layout and terminology (Version 3.1)
***
Before you start using GoldenCheetah let's get familiar with the general UI concept / screen layout and the terminology used for the different sections of the screen. This will help you in walking through the further documentation.

The good news - the UI Layout and user interaction is basically the same on all GoldenCheetah views. But each view has his specific purpose and thus deviates in the content shown to the user.

Looking at the figure above you find the following elements:

### Menu Bar 
The 'Menu Bar' contains all the menu options for GoldenCheetah. The screenshot shown is frome a Windows 7 version. On Mac OSX or modern Linux distributions the 'Menu Bar' will appear on the top (border) of the screen. 

_Note:_ The 'Menu Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable.

More information on the 'Menu Bar' and the different menu functions is provided here: [Menu Bar: Functions] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Menu Bar_Functions)

### Tool Bar 
The 'Tool Bar' contains buttons to get quick access to functions that also available within the menu bar. We place them in the 'Tool Bar' because they are used very commonly, and it is handy to be able to get at them quickly and easily.

_Note: The 'Tool Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable._

More information on the 'Tool Bar' and the available functions is provided here: [Tool Bar: Functions] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Tool Bar_Functions)

### Scope Bar
The 'Scope Bar' is used to select the GoldenCheetah view. Each view offers different functionality as their names suggest. 

_Note: The 'Scope Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable._

### Charts Bar
The 'Charts Bar' shows the different charts for the view active in 'Scope Bar'. The 'Charts Bar' is your selection of charts which are configured for a specific view of the 'Scope Bar'. 

_Note: The 'Charts Bar' differ for each view of the 'Scope Bar' and is configurable for your GoldenCheetah version. With the installation GoldenCheetah provides a standard configuration for the 'Chart Bar' for all views._

If you want to add, delete 'Charts' or reset the 'Charts Bar' to the GoldenCheetah defaults, you find the details here: [Chart Bar: General handling] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Chart Bar_General handling)

### Main View 
Selected via the 'Scope Bar' the main view shows the charts and windows relevant to the view in question. Note that the view can be shown in a tabbed style or a scrolling set of tiles. The only time the main window looks different to that shown above is when running for the first time or when no data is available. In this case a 'splash' screen is shown to assist new users in importing data or setting up devices etc.

### Side Bar 
The 'Side Bar' contains selections and lists that are most appropriate for what the user is currently doing. 

_Note:_ The 'Side Bar' changes as different views are selected in the 'Scope Bar'. 

More information on the Side Bar in general and the variants per view is provided here: [Side Bar: General handling] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Side Bar_General handling)
