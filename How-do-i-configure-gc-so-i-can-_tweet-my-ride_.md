Golden Cheetah allows you to "Tweet your ride". GC will send a message to Twitter with the metrics that you choose and a custom message.

To configure GC to use Twitter, you first have to give GC access to your twitter account so that it can post on your behalf.

To do so, open up the Preferences in GC and select the Twitter tab:

Click on the "Authorize" button. This should open up your preferred browser and connect to Twitter. Once this is done, Twitter will give you a code. Simply copy that code into the "Enter pin" text field and click "Save"

You are now able to post to Twitter.

To do so right click on a ride in the ride column at the left of the screen. You will be prompted with a menu. Choose "Tweet Ride".

From there, a dialog box like this will open:

Chose the metrics you would like to tweet and enter a custom message. Make sure to not go over 140 characters.

Once you click Tweet Ride your ride will be sent to Twitter.

You can also see who else is Tweeting their rides by searching for the hashtag #goldencheetah on Twitter.
