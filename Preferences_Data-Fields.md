Preferences: Data Fields (Version 3.1)
***

_Select:_ `Menu Bar -> Tools -> Options...` to get to the 'Options' Popup.

The 'Data Fields' preferences cover three different areas:

* [Fields] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Preferences_Data-Fields#fields) - here you find the list of additional fields available to either store additional ride data or even to add/overwrite ride data.

* [Notes Keywords] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Preferences_Data-Fields#notes-keywords) - defines the rules, how your rides are "colored" in the calendar(s), in the activity list of the 'Diary' view and in the rides section of the 'Rides' view.

* [Processing] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Preferences_Data-Fields#processing) - allows the configuration of the 'Fix/adjust/correct' tools build into GoldenCheetah.

### Fields

The data fields are structured by 'Screen Tab's which then appear on the 'Rides' view in the 'Details' and 'Summary and Details' charts. Please do also read the description of teh ['Details' Chart] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/ChartTypes_Rides#details).

* Screen Tab - groups the fields on different tabs 
* Field - name of the field - there are 2 cases to consider (1) you to add a completely new field: then make sure that it has a name, which is not used elsewhere in GoldenCheetah (and will never be used in future) (2) you want to make an existing field of GoldenCheetah editable, then please use exactly the field name here and make sure that you assign the correct field type
* Type - technical type of a field - in case of existing GoldenCheetah fields, please use the correct field type (to understand appropiate types, please look at the standard examples GoldenCheetah is providing).
* Values - is a way to restrict and simplify the input into fields of type 'Text' and 'Short Text' - by adding a list of values, seperated by "," for a specific field, only those values can be inputted into that particular field when editing
