Options: Athlete (Version 3.1)
***

The athlete specific data allows to change the settings you have done when creating a new athlete and also completes them by setting up the 'Power' and 'Heartrate' zones for the athlet.

_Note: All on this view is stored for the current athlete._

(Screen Shot: Athlete: About)

In the 'About' tab you can change some basic settings - and add a picture for the athlet (if you want to). To add a picture, just click on the 'picture' area to open a 'File Selector' popup. You can select image files of types (.png, .bmp, .jpg). If you file selector does not show and files, use the operating system dependent search syntax in the 'File Name' field. (e.g. in Windows its "*.*). When selecting a picture it's automatically loaded and copied to your athlete specific data in the 'Athlete Library'.

Fields which you have to maintain on this view are:

* Unit (to set the correct Unit of Measurement) which is used in metrics calculation and display
* Weight (to set the default weight) which is used in metrics calculation and display

For Weight please also check: [Special Topics: Weight settings] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics: Weight settings) 

The next two tabs 'Power' and 'Heartrate' allow you to setup the training zones for the athlete. GoldenCheetah also an independent definition of zones for 'Power' and 'Heartrate' in all aspects of the configuration. In this documentation we assume that you are familiar with the concepts behind training zones and will just explain how zones are configured.
