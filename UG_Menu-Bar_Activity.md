Menu Bar: Activity (Version 3.2)

![Activity Menu] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/MenuBar_Activity.jpg)

GoldenCheetah uses the term "Activity" and "Ride" in a mostly similar way. This is because the main functionality of GoldenCheetah is aimed to analyse ride data (with power). One more term to introduce here is "Workout" - a workout is a prescribed activity plan (e.g. 3x5 minutes at L5).

So most of the functions in this menu relate to rides. Here the list:

* `Download from device...` [explained here] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import)
* `Import from file...` [explained here] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import#importing-from-a-file)
* `Manual ride entry...` - Opens a dialog box to manually create a ride in Golden Cheetah. You can set a number of metrics and metadata. The stress figures can either be estimated or manually entered.

***

* `Share Online...` - Opens a dialog box where you can select with which Websites you want to share your ride data, how to name it and which data series are to be shared. For further details, please check [Special Topics: Upload_Download to_from external web-sites] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special Topics_Upload_Download to_from external web-sites)

* `Export...` - Opens a dialog box to export the currently selected ride. You can choose the directory and the file format - _Note: The file formats are implemented to best knowledge - but since formats evolve or other software does different interpretation there is a risk, that exported files cannot be interpreted, even if the software claims to be able to read a particular format._
* `Batch export...` - In addition to "Export..." allows the selection of multiple files to be exported.

***

* `Upload to TrainingPeaks` - Upload the selected ride to TrainingPeaks
* `Synchronize with TrainingPeaks ...` - Opens a dialog box to synchronize data with TrainingPeaks
* `Tweet Ride` - Open a dialog box to select the data to be tweeted

* `Save ride` - does what is says. Important to know - metrics are only updated, once the ride is saved and only based on saved data. _Note: When closing GoldenCheetah, the system checks if are still any changed but unsaved rides and shows those in a dialog box - offering to save, discard or going back to GoldenCheetah._
* `Delete ride...` - deletes the ride after confirmation in a dialog popup. _Note: Any deleted rides are really deleted - GoldenCheetah does not provide an "un-delete" or "history" function here._
* `Split ride...` - opens the split ride wizard, which searches for breaks in an ride and then allows to split the ride into separate rides. (Useful when forgetting to stop recording.)
* `Combine rides...` - opens the combine activities wizard, which allows to merge two different files from the same ride into a single file. (Useful when having 2 different recordings - e.g from 2 devices and you want to merge the data into one ride).
