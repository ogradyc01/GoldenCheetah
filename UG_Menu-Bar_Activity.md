Menu Bar: Activity (Version 3.2)

![Activity Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/MenuBar_Activity.jpg)

GoldenCheetah uses the term "Activity" and "Activity" in a mostly similar way. This is because the main functionality of GoldenCheetah is aimed to analyse activity data (with power). One more term to introduce here is "Workout" - a workout is a prescribed activity plan (e.g. 3x5 minutes at L5).

So most of the functions in this menu relate to activities. Here the list:

* `Download from device...` [explained here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import)
* `Import from file...` [explained here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import#importing-from-a-file)
* `Manual activity entry...` - Opens a dialog box to manually create a activity in Golden Cheetah. You can set a number of metrics and metadata. The stress figures can either be estimated or manually entered.

***

* `Share Online...` - Opens a dialog box where you can select with which Websites you want to share your activity data, how to name it and which data series are to be shared.

* `Export...` - Opens a dialog box to export the currently selected activity. You can choose the directory and the file format - _Note: The file formats are implemented to best knowledge - but since formats evolve or other software does different interpretation there is a risk, that exported files cannot be interpreted, even if the software claims to be able to read a particular format._
* `Batch export...` - In addition to "Export..." allows the selection of multiple files to be exported.

***

* `Upload to TrainingPeaks` - Upload the selected activity to TrainingPeaks
* `Synchronize with TrainingPeaks ...` - Opens a dialog box to synchronize data with TrainingPeaks
* `Tweet Activity` - Open a dialog box to select the data to be tweeted

* `Save activity` - does what is says. Important to know - metrics are only updated, once the activity is saved and only based on saved data. _Note: When closing GoldenCheetah, the system checks if are still any changed but unsaved activities and shows those in a dialog box - offering to save, discard or going back to GoldenCheetah._
* `Delete activity...` - deletes the activity after confirmation in a dialog popup. _Note: Any deleted activities are really deleted - GoldenCheetah does not provide an "un-delete" or "history" function here._
* `Split activity...` - opens the split activity wizard, which searches for breaks in an activity and then allows to split the activity into separate activities. (Useful when forgetting to stop recording.)
* `Combine activities...` - opens the combine activities wizard, which allows to merge two different files from the same activity into a single file. (Useful when having 2 different recordings - e.g from 2 devices and you want to merge the data into one activity).
