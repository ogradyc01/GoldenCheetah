Function related to activities:

* `Download from device...` [explained here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import)
* `Import from file...` [explained here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import#importing-from-a-file)
* `Manual activity entry...` - Opens a dialog box to manually create a activity in Golden Cheetah. You can set a number of metrics and metadata. The stress figures can either be estimated or manually entered.

***

* `Export...` - Opens a dialog box to export the currently selected activity. You can choose the directory and the file format - _Note: The file formats are implemented to best knowledge - but since formats evolve or other software does different interpretation there is a risk, that exported files cannot be interpreted, even if the software claims to be able to read a particular format._
* `Batch export...` - In addition to "Export..." allows the selection of multiple files to be exported.

***

* `Save activity` - does what is says. Important to know - metrics are only updated, once the activity is saved and only based on saved data. _Note: When closing GoldenCheetah, the system checks if are still any changed but unsaved activities and shows those in a dialog box - offering to save, discard or going back to GoldenCheetah._
* `Delete activity...` - deletes the activity after confirmation in a dialog popup. _Note: Any deleted activities are really deleted - GoldenCheetah does not provide an "un-delete" or "history" function here._
* `Split activity...` - opens the split activity wizard, which searches for breaks in an activity and then allows to split the activity into separate activities. (Useful when forgetting to stop recording.)
* `Combine activities...` - opens the combine activities wizard, which allows to merge two different files from the same activity into a single file. (Useful when having 2 different recordings - e.g from 2 devices and you want to merge the data into one activity).
