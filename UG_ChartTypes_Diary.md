Chart Types: Diary view (Version 3.1)
***

The 'Diary' view offers 'Chart Types' which work on a range of rides. The rides which are considered when opening a chart (which works on a date range) is the setting in your 'Side Bar' -> 'Summary' -> (Monthly, Weekly or Daily summary) - as well as the actual 'Search/Filter' settings. With the 'Side Bar' -> 'Calendar' pane you change the 'Date Range' considered.

_Note: Both selection criteria like the used date range (from 'Side Bar' settings) and 'Search/Filter' can also be configured within a concrete chart of the 'Chart' bar. This means the general settings done in the 'Side Bar' are ignored in such cases._

## Calendar

Provides a full page / monthly / calendar view. Each ride you have done is shown using the same color code like the 'Side Bar' -> 'Calendar' pane and the 'Side Bar' -> 'Activities' pane (as well as the 'Diary' -> 'Navigator' chart type.

You can choose an entry - which is then highlighted - and switch to the 'Activities' view for detailed analysis. Depending on your preferences, certain data field content is populated as calendar text.

The data fields shown as calendar text are those where the check-box 'Diary' is checked. Configuration is done in [`Preferences -> Data Fields`](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Preferences_Data%20Fields)  

## Navigator

Provides a full page 'Activities' list. You can apply an additional 'Search/Filter' query to reduce the list. And you can add, remove, re-order columns.

The way how to add, remove and re-order of columns in the 'Navigator' works the same as [Side Bar - Activities View - Column Header]
