Here you do most of the configuration of GoldenCheetah. The whole configuration is explained here: [Options: General] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Options: General)

A special setting when starting with GoldenCheetah is setting your 'Athlet Library'. This library is actually a directory in your file system. You can either enter a directory name manually in the entry field next to 'Athlet Library' or you use `Browse` to select one.

When changing your library, the athlet(s) of your current library (in case of an emptry entry the GoldenCheetah default library) cannot longer be accessed through 'Menu Bar' function to 'Open' an existing athlet. The 'Athlet Library' which is actively used when you run GoldenCheetah can be retrieved by 

_Select:_ `Menu Bar -> Help -> About GoldenCheetah` This opens a popup like below, which shows the current path of your 'Athlet Library'

GoldenCheetah is not removing your old 'Athlet Library' or deleting any athlet data stored in it. After changing your 'Athlet Library' you can alway switch back to the previous one, but there is currently no feature to move or copy athlets from one library to another.

After selecting a new 'Athlet Library' which is recommended to be an EMPTY directory of your system, you need either to manually takeover your data from the previous library. Or you start with a new athlet in your new library.

When pressing `Save` on the info popup after changing the 'Athlet Library', GoldenCheetah will restart for the change to take effect. If you changed to an empty 'Athlet Library' the 'Choose an Athlet' popup appears, allowing you to create a new athlet. Further information see:
