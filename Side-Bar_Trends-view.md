Side Bar: Trends view (Version 3.1)
***

![SideBar General] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/SideBar_Trends.jpg)

The 'Side Bar' for the 'Trends' view offers five different panes - als illustrated above.

## Date Ranges

Date ranges define for which period in time data is shown in the main view of the 'Trends'. GoldenCheetah comes with a number of pre-defined 'Date Ranges' - which start with 'All Dates' and end with 'Last 12 months'. The predefined data ranges cannot be deleted or changed.

You can add you own data ranges - also called 'Seasons' in multiple ways.

_Note: Please observe that some charts can have their own data range defined for the chart. If this is the case, the 'Date Range' in the 'Side Bar' does not have any effect on the chart._
