_Select:_ `Menu Bar -> Tools -> Options...` to get to the 'Options' Popup.

![Preferences - Appearance - Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/PreferencesAppearance_Overview.jpg)

Here you can define UI appearance of GoldenCheetah.

* `Fonts and Font Sizes` - self-explanatory
* `Line Width` - used in diagramm plotting
* `Antialias` - if checked, quality of plotting is enhanced
* `Ride Scrollbar` - check to show the scrollbar in the 'Rides' pane of 'Rides View' -> 'Side Bar'
* `Ride Headings` - check to show the column header in the 'Rides' pane of 'Rides View' -> 'Side Bar'
* `Styling` - offers currently 2 choices - try to find what suits you best (idea is to be similar to the styling of the used operating systems)
***
* `Theme` - themes are predefined sets of color settings for GoldenCheetah - you can't add/remove any of themes. To use them, select a theme by marking the row with a "mouse-click" and press `Apply Theme`. After that, don't forget to press `Save` to make the change work.

_Note: applying a theme does only change the main colors in GoldenCheetah, not the whole list. You can still define each color separately and overwrite any theme based settings_

On the tab `'Colors'` you can do the individual adjustments to the GoldenCheetah colors:
