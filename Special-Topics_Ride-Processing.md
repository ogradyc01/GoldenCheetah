Special Topics: Ride Processing (Version 3.1)
***

GoldenCheetah provides a number of tools to fix/adjust/correct ride data. The adjustments can either be executing manually for a specific ride, or automatically during import of rides.

The configuration of the available tools is done in ['Preferences'] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Preferences_Data-Fields#processing)


_Note: The fixes are only done to the ride file stored in GoldenCheetah format (.json) - GoldenCheetah does not manipulate any of original data files._

## Adjust Torque

Adjusting torque values allows you to uplift or degrade the torque values when the calibration of your power meter was incorrect. It takes a single parameter: 

* Torque Adjust - this defines an absolute value in poinds per square inch or newton meters to modify values by. Negative values are supported. (e.g. enter "1.2 nm" or "-0.5 pi").
