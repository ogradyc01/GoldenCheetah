Chart Types: Trends view (Version 3.1)
***

The 'Trends' view provides 'Chart Types' which work on a more than one ride. The rides which are considered when opening a chart here selected based on the 'Date Range' selected - as well as the actual 'Search/Filter' settings. 

_Note: Both selection criteria 'Date Range' and 'Search/Filter' can also be configured within a concrete chart of the 'Chart' bar. This means the general settings done in the 'Side Bar' are ignored in such cases._
