Chart Types: Trends view (Version 3.1)
***

The 'Trends' view provides 'Chart Types' which work on a more than one ride. The rides which are considered when opening a chart here selected based on the 'Date Range' selected - as well as the actual 'Search/Filter' settings. 

_Note: Both selection criteria 'Date Range' and 'Search/Filter' can also be configured within a concrete chart of the 'Chart' bar. This means the general settings done in the 'Side Bar' are ignored in such cases._

## Metric Trends

The long term metrics provided by the 'Metrics Trends' covers all pre-defined metrics but allows also to add self-defined 'Best value' metrics as well as 'Estimate' metrics.

### Basic Settings

The first screen of the dialog to add a Metric Trends chart are the basic settings. To ease the configuration, you will see the results of your configuration already in teh 'Preview' section on the left side of the dialog box. This allows easy configuration without a lot navigation between the settings and the resulting chart.

GoldenCheetah comes with a set of 'Presets' for you charts - when creating a new 'Athlete' the presets are taken over to the athlete's library - and from that point on any changes, enhancements of this presets are athlete specific.

The 'Presets' view of the dialog box is multi-functional, so besides using a 'Preset' to configure a new chart, the dialog box offers a full set of 'Preset' administration functions.

* Using a preset
  * `Apply` - applies the settings of the selected presets (= takes over the 'Curves' defined in the 'Preset')

* Maintain presets
  * `Rename` - change the name
  * `Delete` - removes/delete a preset
  * `Move Up` - moves the selected preset 'up' in the list
  * `Move Down` - moves the selected preset 'down' in the list

_Note: Since the presets available here are also used in the 'Library' chart, these functions can be helpful to setup your list of presets / charts for this view. (see [Side Bar - Trends View] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Side-Bar_Trends-view#charts))_
