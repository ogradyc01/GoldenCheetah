Chart Types: Diary view (Version 3.1)
***

The 'Diary' view provides 'Chart Types' which work on a range of rides. The rides which are considered when opening a chart (which works on a date range) is the setting in your 'Side Bar' -> 'Summary' -> (Monthly, Weekly or Daily summar) - as well as the actual 'Search/Filter' settings. With the 'Side Bar' -> 'Calendar' pane you change the date change considered.

Note: Both selection criteria like the used date range (from 'Side Bar' settings) and 'Search/Filter' can also be configured within a concrete chart of the 'Chart' bar. This means the general settings done in the 'Side Bar' are ignored in such cases.
