## Calendar

The calendar allows to select the ride, you want to investigate by "clicking on it", as well as monthly "scrolling" through your data. Days for which rides exist, are colored as defined preferences `Options->Data Fields->Notes Keywords`. 

## Rides

The rides pane shows all rides which have been uploaded to GoldenCheetah for the specific athlete. It offers multiple functions to sort, group - but also functions which are as well available through 'Menu Bar' functions.
