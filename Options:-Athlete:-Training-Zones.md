Options: Athlete: Training Zones (Version 3.1)
***

Setting up the training zones for 'Power' and 'Heartrate' is done a a very similar way. Therefore here only the setup for 'Power' is described in details - and for 'Heartrate' just the small differences are outlined.

(Screen Shot: Options:Athlete:Power, Mark the 4 sections (Create New, Zones/Default Tab, Zones Header, Zones Details)

### Create New:

* From Date: Each set of training zones is defined with a specific 'From Date' - as we assume your zones change over time. 

* Critical Power: This is your CP (abbreviation for CP60) - computed using the Scherer/Monod protocol using 3 and 20 minutes. A seconds threshold which is commonly used in power metrics is FTP (Functional threshold power). In GoldenCheetah all metrics (whether they are defined for CP, or for FTP) are computed using the value defined in the 'Critical Power' field. So depending on which metrics you want to use, you need to set this field accordingly (either th CP60 or FTP). In all UI texts in GoldenCheetah the value is referenced as 'CP' or 'Critical Power'. You need to consider which value you have used, if you compare metrics computed by GoldenCheetah to metrics calculated by other tools.

* W': .....

* +/- or Add/Delete buttons: Depending on you operating system, you will see either +/- buttons or Add/Delete buttons on the screen. '+' or 'Add' is used to create a new set of Zones using the data you entered in the 'Create New' section of the screen. Newly added sets appear in the 'Zones Header' section. And if you select a line in the 'Zones Header' section, the 'Zones Details' section shows the different Zones for this line.

 

The screen has two tabs again, namely 'Critical Power' and 'Default'. It's important to understand the concept of 'Default' as this can save you a lot of time.
