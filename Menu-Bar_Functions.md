Menu Bar: Functions (Version 3.1)
***

The GoldenCheetah 'Menu Bar' is similar to any other applications. So please find the details on the different menus and menu options below.

_Note: There is one difference between Windows and Linux builds and MacOS builds. For Windows and Linux the preferences pane is located unter `Tools -> Options` whilst on MacOS it located under `GoldenCheetah->Preferences`. To be consistent with the Windows 7 screenshots, any pathes to 'Menu Bar' will follow the Windows menu structure._
