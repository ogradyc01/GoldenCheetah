## SEASONS AND EVENTS



### Why are there different types of seasons?

This is to help with planning functions. As of v3 there is no real distinction made.
Adhoc seasons are expected to be used solely as date ranges and have no associated plan.
Whilst other season types may contain plans. This is only relevant for planning
functions that are not available yet.



### What is event used for?

It is only used to annotate a LTM chart -- so you can show an 'event' that happened at
a particular date. There are no rules about what constitutes and event. It could be a
race, a training camp or just a day that was particularly meaningful e.g. illness, crash.


### How do create/edit/delete seasons and events?

Seasons and Events are created and edited in the sidebar for the Home view. Seasons are
listed under date ranges, whilst events are listed under the events sidebar item. In
both cases they can be created and deleted from the sidebar item's drop down menu.

Please note that in v3.1 events can only be created when a user season is selected, since
events are associated with a particular season. This constraint will be removed in v3.2.
