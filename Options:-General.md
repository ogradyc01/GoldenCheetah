On this screen you set several important parameters which are used by GoldenCheetah in different places. 

* Language: This is the language the GoldenCheetah UI comes up. When changing the language this is only taking effect with the next start of GoldenCheetah. When you start GoldenCheetah for the first time on your PC, the system locale (usually the language your operating system is set up) is used as default.

_Note: GoldenCheetah is translated in multiple languages, which you find on the drop-down list. In case texts are not translated for a certain language GoldenCheetah uses the 'English" default texts._

* Crank Length: Is an important parameter for some of the metrics calcated in GoldenCheetah. So maintain carefully.

_Note: As of today the Crank Length is defined for all users and not individual per user.

* Wheelsize: TBC - where is this used

* Use Garmin Smart Recording / Smart Recording Threshold (sec): Garmin devices have a feature called "Smart Recording", where data points are not stored per second, but in variable intervalls. In order to read such files and understand how to handle the gaps, GoldenCheetah cann fill such gaps. To enable this you need to activate 'Use Garmin Smart Recording' and defined the threshold (in seconds) upto which GoldenCheetah shall consider a data gap to be a smart recording gap - which then is filled.
