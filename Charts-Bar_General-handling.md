The 'Charts Bar' is a quick access to the different data views / metrics charts / CP charts / map views / etc. of GoldenCheetah. With the initial installation of GoldenCheetah the 'Charts Bar' is prepopulated with a number of charts and views.

_Note: For each different view of GoldenCheetah (Trends/Diary/Rides/Train) the 'Charts Bar' is different and also any change in configuration of the 'Charts Bar' only takes effect for the respective view._

### Add Chart

Adding a new chart to the 'Charts Bar' of a view can be done in 2 ways:

* `Mouse-click the icon` on the right hand side of each 'Charts Bar' - which then opens open an 'Add Chart' selection which contains the possible content views and chart types for the the currently active 'Scope Bar' view (Trends/Diary/Rides/Train).

* `Menu Bar->View->Add Chart` brings up exactly the same list like the variant before.

The different 'Chart Types' and their availability for the different 'Scope Bar' views is explained here:
