Charts Bar: General handling (Version 3.1)
***

![Charts Bar] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/ChartsBar_Rides.jpg)

The 'Charts Bar' is a quick access to the different data views / metrics charts / CP charts / map views / etc. of GoldenCheetah. With the initial installation of GoldenCheetah the 'Charts Bar' is prepopulated with a number of charts and views.

_Note: For each different view of GoldenCheetah (Trends/Diary/Rides/Train) the 'Charts Bar' is different and also any change in configuration of the 'Charts Bar' only takes effect for the respective view._
