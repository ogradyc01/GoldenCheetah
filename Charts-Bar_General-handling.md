The 'Charts Bar' is a quick access to the different data views / metrics charts / CP charts / map views / etc. of GoldenCheetah. With the initial installation of GoldenCheetah the 'Charts Bar' is prepopulated with a number of charts and views.

_Note: For each different view of GoldenCheetah (Trends/Diary/Rides/Train) the 'Charts Bar' is different and also any change in configuration of the 'Charts Bar' only takes effect for the respective view._

### Add Chart

Adding a new chart to the 'Charts Bar' of a view can be done in 2 ways:

* `Mouse-click the icon` on the right hand side of each 'Charts Bar' - which then opens open an 'Add Chart' selection which contains the possible content views and chart types for the the currently active 'Scope Bar' view (Trends/Diary/Rides/Train).

* `Menu Bar->View->Add Chart` brings up exactly the same list like the variant before.

The different 'Chart Types', their availability for the different 'Scope Bar' views, and their configuration settings are explained here:

### Configure Chart / Close Chart

Configuration and closig (= removing from Chart Bar) of a chart is done using the 'More...' function reached through mouse-over in the left/top corner of the 'Main View'.

Depending on the type of chart, you one or many options available on 'More...". In our example you have:

* Close - this is available for ANY chart and removes the chart from the 'Chart Bar' after asking if you really want to do this.
* Export Chart Image... - for charts which have graphics/plots - opens a dialog to export the graphic/plat as a graphics file (in .png) format. The export basically create an internal screenshot of the VISIBLE area of the 'Main View'. If you chart is bigger than that, only the visible part will be exported.
* All Chart Settings - open the chart type specific 'Chart Settings' dialog. These dialogs are exactly the same to those when adding a chart. (See [Chart Types] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/General_ChartTypes)

_Note: For some of the chart types, there is an accelerated access to their most common configuration settings also revealed by the 'mouse-over' to 'More...' as part of a semi-transparent overlap on the upper border of the 'Main View'. You can change the available settings, without to got to 'All Chart Settings'. The overlay is available is long as the mouse cursor stays in the semi-transparent area._
