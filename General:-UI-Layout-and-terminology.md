General: UI Layout and terminology (Version 3.1)
***
Before you start using GoldenCheetah let's get familiar with the general UI concept / screen layout and the terminology used for the different sections of the screen. This will help you in walking through the further documentation.

The good news - the UI Layout and user interaction is basically the same on all GoldenCheetah views. But each view has his specific purpose and thus deviates in the content shown to the user.

(Screen Shot: Main Window Elements)

Looking at the figure above you will see the following components:

### Menu Bar 
The 'Menu Bar' contains all the menu options for GoldenCheetah. The screenshot shown is frome a Windows 7 version. On Mac OSX or modern Linux distributions the 'Menu Bar' will appear on the top (border) of the screen. 

_Note:_ The 'Menu Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable.

### Tool Bar 
The 'Tool Bar' contains buttons to get quick access to functions that also available within the menu bar. We place them in the 'Tool Bar' because they are used very commonly, and it is handy to be able to get at them quickly and easily.

_Note: The 'Tool Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable._

### Scope Bar
The 'Scope Bar' is used to select the GoldenCheetah view. Each view offers different functionality as their names suggest. 

_Note: The 'Scope Bar' layout and content is the same for all views and not configurable._

### Charts Bar
The 'Charts Bar' shows the different charts for the view active in 'Scope Bar'. The 'Charts Bar' is your selection of charts which are configured for a specific view of the 'Scope Bar'. 

_Note: The 'Chart Bar' different for each view of the 'Scope Bar' and configurable for your GoldenCheetah version. GoldenCheetah provides a standard configuration for the 'Chart Bar' for all views._

If you want to add, delete 'Charts' or reset the 'Chart Bar' to the GoldenCheetah default, please have a look at the description [Chart Bar: General handling] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Chart Bar: General handling)

### Side Bar 
The 'Side Bar' contains selections and lists that are most appropriate for what the user is currently doing. It changes as different views are selected in the 'Scope Bar'.  

Main View - selected via the scope bar the main view shows the charts and windows
relevant to the view in question. Analysis View contains analysis functions and so on.
Note that the view can be shown in a tabbed style or a scrolling set of tiles.
The only time the main window looks dierent to that shown above is when running for
the rst time or when no data is available. In this case a `splash' screen is shown to assist
new users in importing data or setting up devices etc.
