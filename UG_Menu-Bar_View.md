The View menu provides a menu access to the 

* `Toggle Full Screen` - also (for some OS) available on 'F11' - use 'ESC' to return to 'Window' mode
* `Switching on/off` of certain UI elements ('Side Bar' / 'Compare Pane' / 'Tool Bar' / 'Athlete Tabs')

***

* `Active view` - (Trends / Diary / Rides / Train) - same as provided by the 'Scope Bar'

***

* `Add Chart` - opens a sub-menu to select a chart to add to the charts bar of the specific view you are on (Trends / Diary / Rides / Train). Dependent on the main view a different selection of chart types is offered here. After selection a chart type, a dialog box appears, allowing you to adjust the chart settings as you want, before the chart is added to the current view. To get an overview of the different chart types please check: [Chart Types](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_ChartTypes_General)
* `Reset Layout` - will reset the current view layout to the application default. To avoid any accidental loss of your setting an additional dialog box asks to confirm this step.
* `Tabbed not Tiled` - toggles tabbed or tiled mode for the current view.
