## GENERAL


### What is GoldenCheetah?

GoldenCheetah is primarily a program for cyclists that own a power meter. It allows them to
record, track and review their performance against recorded data. It also allows you to ride
your turbo and collect data as you ride.

If you do not have a power meter then some of the functionality will not be of use to you
as a cyclist. But you can still record and track progress. We support HR based TRIMP metrics
for a HR based PMC for example.



### What is a good book or resource on training with power?

Unquestionably the bible for working with a power meter is Training and Racing with a Power
Meter by Hunter Allan and Andy Coggan. Make sure you look at the 2nd edition since it is
revised quite dramatically. Whilst it is heavily  biased towards WKO+ as a software package
most of the functions of note are also available in GoldenCheetah.



### Where can I download the installer for GoldenCheetah ?

Stable releases are available from <http://www.goldencheetah.org> whilst the latest and greatest
code build is available from <http://goldencheetah.stand2surf.net>. Development builds are for the
brave, since they may contain bugs. In reality the development builds are a changing feast
and often contain latest fixes too.



### Where can I get the source code?

The GoldenCheetah source code is hosted on github and can be cloned using the following url;
        git://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah.git



### I am a triathlete is GoldenCheetah appropriate for me?

GoldenCheetah is not a multi-sport program. For tracking cycling performance it is a good
choice. But if you are looking for running and swimming metrics and tracking then these
features are not available at present. It is an excellent choice for analysing cycling
aspects of triathlon, or working on the trainer.



### Is there a mailing list?

The mailing list for GoldenCheetah users is maintained via Google Groups at
<http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#forum/golden-cheetah-users> the first post you
make is moderated and may take a while to appear. Once your first post is made you can
make future posts without moderation.



### How do I report a bug or request a new feature?

We use Github issues to record bugs and feature requests. You will need to create an
account on github and then post a new request or bug at
<http://www.github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/issues>



### How can I contribute?

Patches are most welcome via the mailing list or a pull request in github. Of equal
importance is the timely reporting of bugs and help in testing fixes. We also desperately
need volunteers to translate into non-English languages and help with writing documentation
including the maintenance of this FAQ.

If you want to help, post a note on the golden-cheetah-users mailing list.



### Can I donate to the project?

We are a free software project. Free as in freedom. Our software is developed by a community.
We do not have any facility to collect funding or spend it! We would rather you spread the word if you
think our software is good, and maybe help out with documentation, tutorials or
translations if you can.
