Chart Types: Rides view (Version 3.1)
***

The 'Rides' view provides 'Chart Types' which work on a single ride. The ride in focus can be selected in various ways, e.g. through the 'Side Bar' -> 'Rides' pane, but also by selecting a ride on the 'Navigator' or 'Calendar' on the 'Diary' view.

## Ride Summary
A summary chart is chart with fixed structure, which displays a summary about the current ride you a looking at.

* Contents Section are:
  *Totals, Average, Maximums, Metrics, Model information - the 'Metrics' shown are configurable through 'Preferences' -> 'Metrics' -> 'Summary'
* Power Zones - the power zones as configured in 'Preferences' for the date the ride took place
* Heart Rate Zones - the heart rate zones as configured in 'Preferences' for the date the ride took place

## Details

The ride 'Details' allow to view, change and enter ride specific data. Some of the fields are pre-populated with ride file data (e.g. 'Start Date' and 'Start Time').

The content of the 'Details' base on the configuration done in [Preferences->Data Fields] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Preferences_Data%20Fields#fields)

Here the 'Workout' Tab as an example to show the relationship:

![Ride Details - Workout Settings] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/Ride_Details-Workout-Config.jpg)

Important to know is: The sequence of the 'Tab's on the 'Details' screen and the sequence of the field per 'Tab' is the sequence of the configuration list. When adding or removing a field to the configuration, GoldenCheetah needs a few seconds to re-check / adjust it's interal structures and to re-create the screens (by adding the new field). 

_Note: GoldenCheetah comes with a set of field preferences, which already contain a number of additional fields for ride specific data, as well as a proposal on field for the 'Metric' tab. Since for some of these field specific logic is implemented in GoldenCheetah, it is clearly NOT recommended to remove any of the pre-defined fields._
