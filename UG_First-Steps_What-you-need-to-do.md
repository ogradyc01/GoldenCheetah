***
The minimum (without this you will not even reach the main screen of GoldenCheetah):

1. [Download GoldenCheetah and install it on your PC ](UG_First Steps_Prerequisites)
2. [Set up the first athlete](UG_First Steps_Your first athlete) 
3. [Get you first ride(s) downloaded from device or imported from files](UG_First Steps_Download or import) 

In addition to minimum there is some configuration you should look at and configure it to your needs before starting loading lots of data into GoldenCheetah. Even though GoldenCheetah handles later changes in configuration, doing some of this in the beginning will give you a better metrics on your data from the start:

### Important settings to look at before going into details

1. [Check and configure your athlete library](UG_Special Topics_Setting the athlete library) 
2. [Define language and other general settings] (http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Preferences_General) 
3. [Defining your training zones](UG_Preferences_Athlete_Training-Zones)
