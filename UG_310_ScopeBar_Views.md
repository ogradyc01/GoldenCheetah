Scope Bar: Views (Version 3.1)
***

![Scope Bar] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/ScopeBar_Views.jpg)

The 'Scope Bar' provides access to the 'Main View' variants GoldenCheetah is offering. Each view has a specific purpose and therefore specific capabilities. The general layout and UI for all views is following the same pattern. Still there are differences, which are important to understand when using GoldenCheetah:

## Trends

In 'Trends' its all about long term analysis of athlete data. Showing summaries, history data, for sure the PMC (Performance Manager Chart) and aggregated CP curves. You can either use pre-defined 'Date Ranges' for the analysis - or define your own 'Data Ranges' called 'Seasons' - to focus on certain training phases / cycles.

_Note: A very useful new feature in 3.1 in 'Trends' is the ability to 'Compare' the athlete data of different 'Date Ranges' with each other. And here not only data of a single athlete, but also cross multiple athletes._

3. [Compare Pane] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_310_Compare-Pane_General)

## Diary

The 'Diary' view is a kind of bridge between 'Trends' - where you analyse mid- and long-term aspects of your training, and the analysis of a single ride in 'Rides'. In 'Diary' you find different types of summaries, an configurable Ride/Activity Log and a 'big' calendar. You can use some chart types which are also available on 'Trends' view.

_Note: Diary does not provide a 'Compare Pane', so the respective menu function and tool bar button has no effect._

## Rides

The 'Rides' view - as it's name says - deals with a SINGLE ride. The 'Side Bar' for the 'Rides' view provides necessary navigation functions to select a ride. The analysis of the ride is done in the 'Main View'. Here you find also charts like 'Maps' showing where you have been riding (if your data contains GPS information) and a number of analysis charts for your ride data. In addition to the analysis of the full ride, many of the functions are prepared to also analyse 'Intervals' of your ride. 

_Note: A very useful new feature in 3.1 in 'Rides' is the ability to 'Compare' the multiple rides and/or intervals for single or multiple rides._
