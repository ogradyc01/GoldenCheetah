Chart Types: General Information (Version 3.1)
***

This is an overview / link page of the different chart types available in GoldenCheetah. Each chart type will be described regarding it's capabilities and specialities. The focus will be on a functional description, not on how-to-use such charts to evaluate your data / to optimize your training.
