Chart Types: General Information (Version 3.1)
***

This is an overview / link page of the different chart types available in GoldenCheetah. Each chart type will be described regarding it's capabilities and specialities. The focus will be on a functional description, not on how-to-use such charts to evaluate your data / to optimize your training.

Since some of the chart types appear in more than one Scope View (Trends / Diary / Rides), it will be described only once - and this description will be referenced from the other occurences.
