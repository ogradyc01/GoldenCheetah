## Elite Qubo Digital Wireless
The [Elite Qubo Digital](http://www.elite-it.com/en/products/trainers/indoor-trainers/qubo-digital) can be controlled from GoldenCheetah.

_When controlling the trainer directly from GoldenCheetah the ANT+ head unit needs to be turned off/removed from the cradle to prevent it sending conflicting instructions._

In one of the three manual GB train modes, the resistance of the trainer can be either set to a specific resistance of 16 levels, a target power in which the trainer attempts to match the resistance to the required power or to a gradient where the target power is adjusted based on slope and rider weight.
Similarly in "ERG" mode the target power will be constantly adjusted, and in "CRS" mode the target gradient will be controlled.

In target power mode the trainer can only match the required power within a range of speeds, if the ride speed is too low or too high for the requested power the speed will be highlighted in the telemetry.
In target gradient mode the calculated power will be unreliable at slow speeds, although this should be clear to see.

Speed and cadence data is provided by the trainer, the cadence value is computed by the trainer and so in some circumstances may be innaccurate. An optical sensor can be attached to the trainer to provide exact readings if necessary.
