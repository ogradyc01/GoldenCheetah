First Steps: Download or import (Version 3.1)
***

### Downloading a ride from device

If you use a Powertap, SRM, Joule, Joule GPS or Macro-X device you will be able to download from it directly. Please make sure the device is conected and plugged in correctly. For example, if you are downloading from a Powertap please make sure the computer is firmly connected and displays 'HOST' on its screen.

To start the download go ahead and click the download from device button. This will open up the download dialog. Select the right kind of device and serial port before clicking on the 'Download' button. If no serial port is listed, or the port is not correct you can click on the 'Rescan' button to look again for your device. This is sometimes required if you click on 'Download' before the device is connected. Any ride files will then be downloaded and imported into GoldenCheetah and the splash screen will disappear to reveal the 'Rides' view of GoldenCheetah. Congratulations - you can now start using GoldenCheetah to analyse and track your performance.

### Importing from a file

To import les into GoldenCheetah you have a couple of options. You can drag and drop them from a file explorer or from the desktop into the main GoldenCheetah window, or you can select them via the import files button on the splash screen. Once you have done either the import rides wizard will appear to process the selected files.

You will notice that the files are opened first to ensure you have the required permissions to read them before being validated. Once validated the dialog will prompt you to edit any of the dates (some file formats do not include date information). Once you have set the dates (if needed) you can click on save to complete the import and save the files to disk.

_Note: You can either use the drop-down list to set a date, or you can click on the 'Date' and 'Time' field in the list of imported files, to make the field editable (using Windows 7 a 'double-click' is required for the fields to open for input)._

The splash screen will now disapper and reveal the main GoldenCheetah 'Rides' view and you can now start analysing and tracking your performance.
