First Steps: Your first athlet (Version 3.1)
***
When you run GoldenCheetah for the very first time, you need to create you first athlete through the "Choose an Athlet" dialog box.

(Screenhot: Choose an Athlet)

At a later stage (when having multiple athlets created) - see Special Topics: Handling multiple athlets you can select one of those. But here you have to select "New..." which opens another dialog window to create a new athlete and set some basic data.
