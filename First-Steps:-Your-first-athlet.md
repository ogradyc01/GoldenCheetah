First Steps: Your first athlet (Version 3.1)
***
When you run GoldenCheetah for the very first time, you need to create you first athlete through the "Choose an Athlet" dialog box.

(Screenhot: Choose an Athlet)

At a later stage (when having multiple athlets created) - see [Special Topics: Handling multiple athlets](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics: Handling multiple athlets) you can select one of existing ones. But here you have to select "New..." which opens another dialog window to create a new athlete and set some basic data.

(Sreenshot: New Athlet Dialog)

Whilst it is possible to congure these values in preferences or within an individual activity
you should go ahead and set up as much of the data as accurately as possible. These values
are used as defaults in many metric calculations.

If you click on the blank athlete icon on the right it is possible to set an image for the
athlete too. This isn't used anywhere at present, but that may change in the future.

_Note:_ Since GoldenCheetah 3.1 it is possible to define an explicite "Athlete Directory" in which all the data of the created athletes are stored. When starting GoldenCheetah for the first time, your first athlet is created in the "default directory" which might deviate from directory you want to use.

If you want to use a different athlete directory than the default one, please follow the guide [Special Topics: Setting the athlet directory](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics: Setting the athlet directory) after your have created and saved your first athlet.
