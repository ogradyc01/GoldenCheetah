Menu Bar: Activity (Version 3.1)

![Activity Menu] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/MenuBar_Activity.jpg)

GoldenCheetah uses the term "Activity" and "Ride" mostly similar. This is because the main functionality GoldenCheetah is to analyse ride data (with power). One more term to introduce here is "Workout" - a workout is a prescribed activity plan (e.g. 3x5 minutes at L5).

So most of the functions in this menu relate to rides. Here the list and some small explanations:
