Menu Bar: Athlete (Version 3.1)
***

![Athlete Menu] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joern-R/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/MenuBar_Athlete.jpg)

After creating your first athlete, GoldenCheetah will by default start with opening the last used athlete in a single window. If your are working with multiple athletes - in the same athlete library - you can either

* opens the selected athlete in a separate window (or)
* opens the selected athlete as separate "tabs" in the same window

You can see all athletes available in your athlete library when choosing "Open Window" or "Open Tab". Athletes, which are already opened (either in a separate window, or on a tab) are "light grey" and are not selectable any more.

You can also crate a new ahtlete in the active athlete library here. The other functions (Close, Quit) are self-explanatory. 

For further details on "Athlete library" read [Setting the athlete library] (https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special-Topics_Setting-the-athlete-library)
