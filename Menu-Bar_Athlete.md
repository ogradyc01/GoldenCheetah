Menu Bar: Athlete (Version 3.1)
***

![Athlete Menu] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/master/doc/wiki/MenuBar_Athlete.jpg)

After creating your first athlete, GoldenCheetah will by default start with opening the last used athlete in a single window. If your are working with multiple athletes - in the same athlete library - you can either

* open the selected athlete in a separate window (or)
* open the selected athlete as separate "tab" in the same window

You can see all athletes available in your athlete library when choosing `Open Window` or `Open Tab`. Athletes, which are already opened (either in a separate window, or on a tab) are "light grey" and are not selectable any more.

You can also create a new ahtlete in the active athlete library here. The other functions (Close, Quit) are self-explanatory.
