To find your power peaks for a ride and automatically create intervals around them:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the "Analysis" tab on the top-right side of the window.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the activity you are interested from the window on the left side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click on your selected activity and select "Find power peaks"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look below the activity in the interval tab and you will see new power peak intervals listed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the "Ride" tab at the top of the main graph window.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on one of your power peak intervals (the "Peak 10min" interval, for example) and you will see it highlighted in blue in the "Ride" chart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag the sliders at the bottom of the window to closely encompass your interval so that you can see it in more detail.<br>
