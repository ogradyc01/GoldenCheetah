First Steps: Your first athlete (Version 3.1)
***
When you run GoldenCheetah for the very first time, you need to create you first athlete through the "Choose an Athlet" dialog box.

(Screenhot: Choose an Athlet)

At a later stage (when having multiple athlets created) see [Special Topics: Handling multiple athlets](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics: Handling multiple athlets) 
you can select one of existing ones. But here you have to select "New..." which opens another dialog window to create a new athlete and set some basic data.

(Sreenshot: New Athlet Dialog)

Whilst it is possible to configure these values in preferences or within an individual activity you should go ahead and set up as much of the data as accurately as possible. These values are used as defaults in many metric calculations.

Details in the fields can be found on [Configuration: Athlet](http://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Configuration: Athlet)

_Note: Since GoldenCheetah 3.1 it is possible to define an explicite "Athlete Directory" in which all the data of the created athletes are stored. When starting GoldenCheetah for the first time, your first athlet is created in the "default directory". If you consider using a different athlete directory than the default one, please follow the guide [Special Topics: Setting the athlet directory](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Special Topics: Setting the athlet directory) 
after your have created and saved your first athlet and before importing any rides and changing any other configuration of GoldenCheetah. (As of today GoldenCheetah does not provide a feature to copy athlet data between different directories - this would be a manual step for which you need to understand to data storage concepts of GoldenCheetah. So selecting the correct athlet directory before adding an rides is a important step.)_

Once you're happy with the athlet settings click save and you will then be able to select your new athlete in that initial dialog (except of course there is now an athlete listed). Go ahead and open that athlete and you will be greeted with GoldenCheetah, but a splash page.

This page is shown because there is no data associated with this athlete. We need to go ahead and download some data from your bike computer or import some data from disk or USB.
