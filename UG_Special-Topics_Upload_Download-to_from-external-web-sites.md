* CALDAV Calendar / Google Calendar

### CALDAV Calendar

For a generic CALDAV Calendar you need to enter the URL (please check with your CALDAV provider) and Username/Password for the authorization. If you CALDAV Calender has a different authorization approach than Username/Password it can't be accessed by GoldenCheetah (only exception is the Google Calendar).

### Google Calendar

The Google Calendar (CALDAV access) requires the Google Calendar ID - which you find in your Google Calendar settings - the 'default' CalID is your Google e-mail address.

After entering a proper CalID you need to authorize GoldenCheetah to access this Calendar - by pressing `Authorize`, login on to Google with your User/PW and granting GoldenCheetah the right to access your calendar.



* Trainingstagebuch

* Selfloops

* Velo Hero
